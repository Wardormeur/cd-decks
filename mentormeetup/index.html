            Explaining variables, type manipulation & basic math implementation, for a first language
            -> Then algorythm implementation/ whatever, but one by one as much as possible
            Specific :
             - usage of a tracker/sensor on smartphone; or touch; or camera
             - usage of GPIO on raspberry;
             - usage of keyboard on laptop
            /me then only did i do an app demonstrating only one functionnality, slightly extended "shakIt"
            Not speaking of files and so on, simply of being able to use functions rather than inlining everything
            -> make them understand that's it's easier to read code when one function does one thing
            --> Single Responsibility Principle
            --> ex Scracth multi entity and global variable "state" conflict
            Incremental save = git => better images for the guide
            Normal workflow = "want to try this language"
            -> Nobody expect 10y exp, but may not tbe able to explain "why this piece of code" to anybody
            -> Confusion is big enough when you start a new language, don't overload it
            /me AppInventor first app fruitNinja, contains everything because I was trying things out

          <h1>Creating a sushi card: phase 2</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Get it proof read</li>
            <li>Find some kids interested to test it</li>
            <li>Share it!</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            You know, language and 11pm writing with bourbon
            Paper is great for kids to give some feedback, or use online inline-comments (TODO: provide ex)
            -> comprehension rather than technicality
            -> collect "how to do x ?"
            --> let them dig !
            The situation has been a bit unstable on the foundation side regarding submission of sushi cards
            -> and i have a quite strong disagreement with Philip regarding strategy :p
            -> push them to Gitbook and share a link on the forum for peer review from others mentors !

            How many ppl here are not native Irish or speak fluently another language?
            Language switch : avoid translating variable, the coding language WILL BE in english
            -> Comment could be translated, but i think we should avoid them inline and put them into the sushi
            French is incredibly verbose compared to English : translate the idea, not word by word
            -> It may say what the original author wanted, but will be hard to read as a native
            As French, and coming back from latin, we have another pronoun to differenciate formal from informal
            -> It's not directly context based as it is in English
            -> Relative to country in which the sushi card is used
            -> I think for this kind of differences, and for consistency, a choice must be made w/ the rest of the community

            Strongly relate, alas
            I think one o the easy value of beeing a community is its part of co-working on different subject
            Some of you are probably aware of the community meetings led by Pete/Ross/Nuala that
            joins different dojos from a country of from multiple ones
            Same could be done for translation? A one man job is tiring and depressing on the long run, don't stay alone
